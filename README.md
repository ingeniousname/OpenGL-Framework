<h2>OpenGL-Framework</h2>

A simple OpenGL library framework.

The framework allows drawing 3D shapes with a simple renderer, simple texturing, it has a simple resource manager and shader wrapper class. It is a base for my future projects with OpenGL.

Lately I was working on OBJ file loading, if you compile the project successfully you should see a loaded shape rotating.

Compilation requires linking -lglfw3, -lglew32 and -lopengl32 , hopefully my cmake file works for you :)
